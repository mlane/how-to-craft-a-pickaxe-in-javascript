# How to Craft a Pickaxe (in JavaScript)

A five-minute no-AI experiment in overengineering the simplest idea imaginable.

> The world didn’t need another crafting table.  
> But we built one anyway.

## Introduction

This project started as a joke.

A living reminder that building doesn’t always need a reason.  
Sometimes the fun is the reason.

In Minecraft, every recipe begins with a blank 3×3 grid.  
In JavaScript, it’s similar — you start with a few simple states and see what they become.

## The Idea

A 3×3 grid of buttons.  
Each toggles between empty and filled.  
When you match the right pattern — the pickaxe recipe — it “crafts” a React component.

No backend. No AI. No reason.  
Just JavaScript pretending to be a crafter.

## Why This Exists

Because developers forget that creativity doesn’t need purpose.  
You can build for five minutes and still feel alive after.

This isn’t a demo. It’s a moment — a reminder that your hands still remember how to make things.
